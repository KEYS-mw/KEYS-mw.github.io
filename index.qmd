Our *vision* is to be the global organization in providing research, sustainable and innovative solutions to transform the lives of rural people.

Our philosophy is driven by the dreams and desires of the elders and youth for a better community. KEYS (Knowledge Elders, Youth Share) propels our efforts to maximize information-sharing for conserving culture and the natural environment. The information shared will then be processed and passed on to the next and future generations within their communities and beyond.

## Core topics

We are realizing our aims along four core topics: 

* Knowledge Share -- continually seeking and sharing knowledge to improve ourselves and the organization.
* Capacity building -- focused on enhancement of abilities and skills of members through training to develop their potential and contribute to their community and organization.
*	Entrepreneurship creation -- emphasizing on development of new businesses or initiatives and self-employment.
*	Advocacy -- Actively supporting and promoting a well-being through speaking up, awareness raising, and working towards positive change (lobbying for policy changes, campaigns or building alliances to address social issues).
