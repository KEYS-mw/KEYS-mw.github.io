    "text": "About ‘Ndatukuka’ Investment Fund\nThe word Ndatukuka is a Chichewa language phrase, the Malawi’s national language that refers to, “I have prospered.” The Ndatukuka phrase denotes a strategy to motivate and remind any member borrowing money from this fund, that its main purpose is to transform their lives and that the money needs not to be misused or abused in any form. The revenues from the sales of legumes are first injected into the Ndatukuka fund, and the members accessing the loans pay back with a fair interest charge to grow the fund and maintain its value. Besides, members also purchase shares which are loaned out to members. So, the phrase Ndatukuka possesses a strong reminder to members to borrow the money for a reason and invest into their businesses wisely and profitably. We hope that Ndatukuka will create jobs and by far instigate sustainable wealth creation."

    "text": "Notable Achievements\nKEYS Organization, or Community-Based Organization, has achieved several projects that have positively impacted its members and the community. Through these projects, KEYS Organization has demonstrated its commitment to community development, capacity building, sustainable agriculture, and empowering its members.\nLet’s break down each of these projects:\n\nRegistering of KEYS Organization\nOne of the foundational achievements of KEYS Organization was the successful registration of the organization. Registering as a community-based organization offers several advantages, including legal recognition, increased credibility, and eligibility for various government programs and funding opportunities. By completing the registration process, KEYS Organization positioned itself as an official and legitimate entity, ensuring its sustainability and ability to operate effectively.\n\n\nFight against child marriage\nSince 2019, KEYS Organization has been fighting child marriage and identified one of the team members as Child Protection Worker to support this effort. Since then, KEYS has foiled or ended more than 20 (potential) child marriages and conducted numerous advocacy and awareness meetings with leaders and community members, reaching almost 2000 persons. In addition, it supports community members caring for children by providing psychosocial counseling and essential items for everyday needs. Moreover, it selected and oriented 14 pre-school teachers and financed a three-day training workshop on this topic together with the Social Welfare Services.\nRecently. the Firelight Foundation joined KEYS in their fight against child marriage by providing financial support and capacity building through the “ending child marriage initiative (ECM)”. Learn more about their engagement on our dedicated page.\n\n\nGrowing of Legumes (Soya and Peanuts)\nKEYS Organization successfully implemented a project focused on the cultivation of legumes as part of focusing on its pillars, entrepreneurship creation. Legumes are an important crop due to their high protein content and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting both farmers and the environment. This project aimed to promote sustainable agriculture practices and improve food and income security within the community. Through training and support, KEYS Organization helped its members to learn effective legume farming techniques, enabling them to increase their crop yields and enhance their livelihoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the KEYS Organization preparation a field for growing legumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSowing of legumes by members of the KEYS Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoy field that financed the establishment of the KEYS Organzation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariety of corn with increased pest resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssortment of corncobs from varieties with increased drought- and pest resistance.\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing Members Investment Fund called ‘Ndatukuka’\nAnother significant milestone of KEYS Organization was the establishment of the Ndatukuka Investment Fund. This initiative aimed to empower members of the organization by providing them with access to financial resources and investment opportunities. The fund could be utilized for various purposes, such as starting or expanding businesses, investing in income-generating activities, or supporting community development projects. By facilitating access to capital and financial literacy, KEYS Organization helped its members unlock economic opportunities and improve their financial well-being.\n\n\nFundraising and financing capacity building of KEYS Organization by the Malawi government\n\n\n\nKEYS Organization prioritized the development and capacity building of its members. The organization successfully fundraised to support various capacity-building initiatives as one of its pillars. These programs included training workshops, skill development sessions, mentorship programs, or access to resources and tools that enhance the knowledge and capabilities of members. By investing in the capacity building of its members, KEYS Organization aimed to empower individuals and strengthen the overall capacity of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Puluputu Mwale, the Executive Director of the KEYS Organization, walking home from the meeting venue after a fundraising event for the KEYS Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding infrastructures to support living heritage traditions\nKEYS Organzation collaborates with international partners to build infrastructures that support living heritage traditions and environmental resilience through them.\n\n\n\nIts work and achievements were showcased in a research paper at the 16th PANAF Congress in Zanzibar (Tanzania). This opportunity allowed the organization to share its experiences, best practices, and lessons learned with a wider audience. By presenting at a conference, KEYS Organization not only contributed to the body of knowledge in its field but also gained recognition and exposure, potentially opening doors for collaborations, partnerships, and future opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Executive Director of the KEYS Organization, Frank Puluputu Mwale, at the 16th PANAF Congress in Zanzibar, Tanzania.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe KEYS Organization gratefully acknowledges the Pan African Archaeological Congress for supporting KEYS Executive Director Puluputu Mwale’s registration for his participation in the session “Imagining Futures: Beyond Archives and Archiving” at the 16th Pan-African Archaeological Congress, “Learning from the African Pasts to Manage Local and Global Disasters.”\nThe presented resulted in the peer-reviewed article Living Heritage, Resilience and Ethically Informed Infrastructures in Malawi in the journal Studies in the African Past1, co-authored with Martha Lerski of Lehman College of the City University of New York, USA. Together with Thomas Rose and Martha Lerski, Mwale continues to develop protocols for documenting, conserving, and sharing sustainability-linked intangible cultural heritage. The overall idea of this collaboration was also outlined in the poster Documenting Traditional Ecological Knowledge for Mitigating Climate and Environmental Change: Presenting an Emerging Initiative, presented at the 30th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Archeologists in 2024.\n\n\n1 Read the author accepted version without access restrictions HERE."

Currently, it is building an office to increase the visibility and accessibility of information on this topic. It raises awareness on this topic through the organization of advocacy and awareness meetings and workshops, which have already reached almost 2000 people. Moreover, it foiled potential and ended existing child marriages in over 20 cases. Elderly individuals caring for children are offered psychosocial counselling and essential items for everyday needs by the KEYS Organization and 14 persons were selected and trained as pre-school teachers.\nLearn more about the activities of KEYS Organization against child marriage in this document: \nIn 2024, the Firelight Foundation selected the KEYS Organization as grantee partner. Being a grantee, KEYS Organization will receive financial support and capacity building through the Firelight Foundation for the next four years, helping them in their fight against child marriage through their approach of community-driven systems change (CDSC).\n\n\n\nAs a first or learning phase, KEYS Organization identifies the root causes for child marriage, identify key stakeholders to be involved and designing a methodology to collect information, compile the results of their research and their learnings. This includes capacity building events on how to write a proposal and budget. In the second or implementation phase, the developed strategies are put into practice to find and implement strategies to address the underlying issues that lead to the practice of child marriage.

    "section": "Who we are",
    "text": "Who we are\nKEYS (Knowledge Elders, Youth Share) was envisioned in 2017 and was formally recognized by the Government of Malawi in February 2022. The organization was created around local needs and knowledge systems relating to economic sustainability, agriculture, and climate change. Gender balance and participation across age cohorts are embedded in the infrastructure of the organization. The formal registration solidified KEYS Community Based Organization’s (CBO) commitment to its mission and allowed for increased credibility, access to funding opportunities, and enhanced partnerships with other organizations and stakeholders. KEYS joins together a diverse network of volunteers, local authorities, and stakeholders who share our vision. The community members and stakeholders collectively propose the right projects for building resilience and mitigating the impact of climate change. These efforts are aimed at reducing vulnerability and improving adaptability to climate change for rural people.\nKEYS has 73 volunteers who belong to 8 committees. Three of them coordinate the activities of the organization. Volunteering is one of the important ways of the organization to pursue its mission. KEYS has ambitious targets and envisions mobilizing hundreds of multi-talented people each year to team up with other organizations in conserving the environment and valued cultural elements. The organization employs a cultural session approach to promote sharing of information and working relationships between the elders and youth. Together, KEYS committees and the community propose environmentally friendly entrepreneurship to generate income and build resilience. It is KEYS’ hope that bringing elders and youth together will overcome existing economic inequalities and the decay of valued cultural elements through improved relationships and reliance on one another for knowledge, ideas, and talents (youth vs elderly people)."
