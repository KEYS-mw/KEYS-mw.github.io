title: "Fight against child marriage"
---

KEYS Organization engages against child marriage since many years and identified one of its members as Child Protection Worker. Currently, it is building an office to increase the visibility and accessibility of information on this topic. It raises awareness on this topic through the organization of advocacy and awareness meetings and workshops, which have already reached almost 2000 people. Moreover, it foiled potential and ended existing child marriages in over 20 cases. Elderly individuals caring for children are offered psychosocial counselling and essential items for everyday needs by the KEYS Organization and 14 persons were selected and trained as pre-school teachers.
