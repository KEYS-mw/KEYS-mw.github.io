## About 'Ndatukuka' Investment Fund

The word *Ndatukuka* is a Chichewa language phrase, the Malawi’s national language that refers to, "I have prospered." The *Ndatukuka* phrase denotes a strategy to motivate and remind any member borrowing money from this fund, that its main purpose is to transform their lives and that the money needs not to be misused or abused in any form. The revenues from the sales of legumes are first injected into the *Ndatukuka* fund, and the members accessing the loans pay back with a fair interest charge to grow the fund and maintain its value. Besides, members also purchase shares which are loaned out to members. So, the phrase *Ndatukuka* possesses a strong reminder to members to borrow the money for a reason and invest into their businesses wisely and profitably. We hope that *Ndatukuka* will create jobs and by far instigate sustainable wealth creation.
